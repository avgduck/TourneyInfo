## [TourneyInfo](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-league-blaze/p/avg_duck/TourneyInfo/)

Changes the player display on the main menu to show info about the current tournament, including a custom name, description, and logo. This mod also shows the current version of the tourney modpack, if applicable.

When no custom logo is specified, the LLB Stadium logo will be used.

A custom logo can be a `.png` or `.jpg` file and should be dropped into the Modding Folder, located by default at `<LLB install location>/ModdingFolder/TourneyInfo/`. The image used will be the first file in the folder when sorted by name.
